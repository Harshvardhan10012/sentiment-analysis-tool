# sentiment-analysis-tool
This project is a simple Sentiment Analysis tool built using Python and the TextBlob library. The tool is designed to determine the sentiment of a given text, classifying it as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. It's a great introduction to working with text data and learning how to use pre-built models for natural language processing (NLP).
